# Ex.No:1(E)  STATIC VARIABLE

## AIM:
To write a Java program to print student details (name and age), where age is the same for all students. Use a static variable to represent the age and demonstrate its use in accessing a shared value across all class objects

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.
2.	Create a class named Student.
3.	Declare a static variable age in the Student class.
4.	Declare an instance variable name.
5.	Create a constructor to initialize the student's name.
6.	Define a method displayDetails() to print the student's name and age.
7.	In the main method:
I.	Assign a value to the static variable age.
II.	Create multiple Student objects with different names.
III.	Call the displayDetails() method for each student.
8.	End the program.

```

## Sourcecode.java:
~~~
public class Student {
       static int age;
       String name;
    public Student(String studentName) {
        this.name = studentName;
    }
    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println(Name+" "+age);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student.age = 18;
        Student s1 = new Student("John");
        s1.displayDetails();
    }
}

## RESULT:
Thus, the Java program for the concept of using a static variable for shared data was correctly implemented and verified successfully.
